computer-architecture
=====================
A collection of my computer architecture projects in order from the time period of 01/2014 - 05/2014.
Our goal was to recreate and understand the LC-3b architecture, the architecture that was designed
by a UT professor named Yale Patt. The first two projects were coded in partnership. The remaining
4 projects were coded by myself.

1. Assembler (created by Brandon Wong and Duc Tran)
2. Simulator (created by Brandon Wong and Duc Tran)
3. Simulator v2
4. Interrupt and Exception handler
5. Virtual Memory
6. Pipelined LC-3b architecture

Each project has another readme within of what the project itself encompasses.
