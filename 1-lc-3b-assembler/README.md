Assembler project for the Lc-3b architecture created by Yale Patt
Created by: Brandon Wong and Duc Tran
Creation Date: 1/30/2014

Description: Assembler is to take the assembly language instruction set, and convert it
to machine language based on the Lc-3b instruction set architecture. The program is also
to provide the correct exit codes for the inputs in the instruction set architecture that cause error.
For example undefined label, invalid opcode, invalid constant, and all other errors.
The program will read and parse the assembly program based on the LC-3b instruction set architecture.
You may reference the ISA at the pdf labeled LC-3b ISA.
